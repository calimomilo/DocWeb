            A rotational pop-up restaurant and café serving up the freshest, tastiest street food from different chefs
            every two weeks.

            Amongst the office blocks between stylish Shoreditch and the bustle of the city find our lush spot of
            paradise perched at the edge of Finsbury Square’s popular bowls green. It’s the end of our official first
            day of trading and while it’s still a week away until we have our first street food chefs in occupation,
            we’ve had a ball of a day serving up coffees, ice creams and soft drinks to our new (and hopefully
            returning) customers.

            “I’d like to be a part of something with a bit of soul. I really want to know about the people I’m serving,
            what makes them tick.”
        </p>
        <p>We’ll be open this week Monday to Friday from 8am to 6pm so pop in to say hello and to enjoy an expert
            barista coffee or real fruit ice lolly on Finsbury Square’s Patio.</p>
